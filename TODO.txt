# TODO

Overall:

1. Implement
2. Codegen

## Monitoring

Maybe there's a "thespian runtime" that handles monitoring all actors and
ensuring the various invariants.

Want:

* Build monitor support similar to Erlang's
  * something like link so we can build supervisors
  * Health monitoring to kill "stuck" actors
* Useful runtime metrics
  * Expvar integration?
  * channel utilization
  * agent utilization

## Communication

Make channels ("connections"?) a first-class type, that must be provided when
creating a new agent instance.

Want:

* Abstraction for channels, too
* Some way to support multiple consumers (e.g., multiple demuxes)
* Flexible polling (so, ignore some messages in some modes)
